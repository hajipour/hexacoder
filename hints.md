# Security Hints

List of the security hints that have been used in the security report of our code synthesis pipeline.

| CWE            | Hint |
|----------------|------|
| **CWE-020**    | Data from all potentially untrusted sources should be subject to input validation. |
| **CWE-022-Py** | Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated. Sanitize the user's input using `safe_join` or `os.path.normpath`. |
| **CWE-022-C/C++** | Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated. Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as `realpath()` in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59). |
| **CWE-078**    | Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. If using `subprocess`, avoid using `shell=True`. Alternatively, use `shell=False` instead. |
| **CWE-079**    | Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing XSS. |
| **CWE-094**    | Avoid using `eval`, `exec`, `execfile` functions or validate the user input. Use the `ast.literal_eval()` function. However, consider that an adversary could still cause excessive memory or stack consumption via deeply nested structures. |
| **CWE-117**    | User input should be suitably sanitized before it is logged. If the log entries are plain text, then line breaks should be removed from user input, such as replacing `(old, new)` or similar. Care should also be taken that user input is clearly marked in log entries, and that a malicious user cannot cause confusion in other ways. For log entries that will be displayed in HTML, user input should be HTML encoded before being logged, to prevent forgery and other forms of HTML injection. |
| **CWE-190**    | Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range. Use unsigned integers where possible. This makes it easier to perform validation for integer overflows. When signed integers are required, ensure that the range check includes minimum values as well as maximum values. |
| **CWE-476**    | If all pointers that could have been modified are sanity-checked previous to use, nearly all NULL pointer dereferences can be prevented. |
| **CWE-502**    | When deserializing data, ensure that a new object is populated rather than just deserialized into an existing one. This ensures that the data flows through safe input validation processes and that the functions remain secure. |
| **CWE-611**    | Many XML parsers and validators can be configured to disable external entity expansion. It is recommended to use the `defusedxml` library instead of the native Python XML libraries. The `defusedxml` library is specifically designed to mitigate XML external entity attacks. To guard against XXE attacks with the `lxml` library, you should create a parser with `resolve_entities` set to false. |
| **CWE-787**    | Consider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application's memory:<br> • Double check that the buffer is as large as specified.<br> • When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as `strncpy()`, be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string.<br> • Check buffer boundaries if accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space.<br> • If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions. |
